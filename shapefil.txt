What is a Shapefile?
--------------------
If you don't know, you probably don't need this library.  The Shapefile
format is a new working and interchange format promulagated by ESRI 
(http://www.esri.com/) for simple vector data with attributes.  It is
apparently the only file format that can be edited in ARCView 2, and can
also be exported and imported in ARC/Info.  

An excellent white paper on the shapefile format is available from ESRI, 
and if anyone knows how I can get this in PostScript, or flat text form
I would love to include a copy with this distribution.

The file format actually consists of three files.

XXX.shp - holds the actual vertices.
XXX.shx - hold index data pointing to the structures in the .shp file.
XXX.dbf - holds the attributes in xBase (dBase) format.  


Format
------
I would like to at least paraphrase the ESRI White Paper here eventually ...


Release Notes
-------------
Release V0.9 is sort of a pre-release and hasn't been tested much.  


Maintainer
----------
This library is maintained by Frank Warmerdam (http://www.pci.on.ca/~warmerda)
of PCI (http://www.pci.on.ca/) on his own time.  Please send me bug patches
and suggestions for the library.  Email can be sent to warmerda@leto.pci.on.ca.

I am also interested in talking to knowledgable develops who can suggest
how to get at projection information corresponding to ArcView shapefiles.


Limitations
-----------
 o You can't modify the vertices of existing structures (though you 
   can update the attributes of existing structures, and create new 
   structures).

 o Not written in such a way as to be particularly fast.

 o Doesn't give access to all the bounding rectangle informaton stored in 
   the file .shp file.

 o Doesn't set the last access time properly in the .dbf files.

 o Doesn't recover the working space in SHPGetVertices(), though the buffers
   are shared among all open files.  Usually this is only a few kilobytes.

 o There is now way to syncronize information to the file except to close it.

 o Poor error checking and reporting.

 o Poorly tested. 

 o Not proffesionally supported.

 o Some aspects of xBase files not supported, though I believe they are
   not used by ESRI.


			Shapefile Library API
			=====================

The Shapefile C Library is divided into two parts, one for accessing the
vertex data in the shapefile itself (XXX.shp/XXX.shx) and one for access
the attributes in the xBase file (XXX.dbf).  

Vertex (SHP) API
----------------

The Vertex (SHP) API uses a SHPHandle to represent an open .shp/.shx file pair.
The contents of the SHPHandle are visible (see shapefile.h) but should
be ignored by the application.  It is intended that all information be
accessed by the API functions.

                  ------------------------------------------

SHPHandle SHPOpen( const char * pszShapeFile, const char * pszAccess );

  pszShapeFile:		The name of the layer to access.  This can be the
			name of either the .shp or the .shx file or can
			just be the path plus the basename of the pair.

  pszAccess:		The fopen() style access string.  At this time only
			"r" (read-only) and "r+" (read/write) should be used.

  The SHPOpen() function should be used to establish access to the two files
  for accessing vertices (.shp and .shx).  Note that both files have to 
  be in the indicated directory, and must have the expected extensions in
  lower case.  The returned SHPHandle is passed to other access functions, 
  and SHPClose() should be invoked to recover resources, and flush changes 
  to disk when complete.


void SHPGetInfo( SHPHandle hSHP, int * pnEntities, int * pnShapeType );

  hSHP:			The handle previously returned by SHPOpen() 
			or SHPCreate().

  pnEntities:		A pointer to an integer into which the number of
			entities/structures should be placed.  May be NULL.

  pnShapetype:		A pointer to an integer into which the shapetype
			of this file should be placed.  Shapefiles may contain
			either SHPT_POINT, SHPT_ARC, SHPT_POLYGON or 
			SHPT_MULTIPOINT entities.
			
                  ------------------------------------------

double *SHPReadVertices( SHPHandle hSHP, int iShape, int *pnVCount,
	 		 int * pnPartCount, int ** ppanParts );

  hSHP:			The handle previously returned by SHPOpen() 
			or SHPCreate().

  iShape:		The entity number of the shape to read.  Entity 
			numbers are between 0 and nEntities-1 (as returned
			by SHPGetInfo()).

  pnVCount:		Pointer to an integer into which the number of 
			vertices can be placed.  Currently must not be NULL.

  pnPartCount:		Pointer to an integer into which the number of
			``parts'' should be placed.  This may be NULL
			for SHPT_POINT and SHPT_MULTIPOINT files which
			don't have parts.

  ppanParts:		Pointer to a pointer to integers.  This pointer will
			be assigned to point to an internal array of parts
			managed by SHPReadVertices().  

  The SHPReadVertices() call is used to read a single structure, or entity
  from the shapefile.  A shape may consists of multiple parts (the outline
  and interior holes for a polygon) which will be indicated by the ppanParts
  values returned.   The values returned in ppanParts will be the offsets
  to the first vertex of each part.

  The return value of SHPReadVertices() is a pointer to an internally managed
  list of vertices.  Note that the values returned as ppanParts and the vertex
  list are only valid untill the next call to SHPReadVertices() at which point
  the internal buffers will be reused.

                  ------------------------------------------

void	SHPClose( SHPHandle hSHP );

  hSHP:			The handle previously returned by SHPOpen() 
			or SHPCreate().

  The SHPClose() function will close the .shp and .shx files, and flush
  all outstanding header information to the files.  It will also recover
  resources associated with the handle.  After this call the hSHP handle
  cannot be used again.

                  ------------------------------------------

SHPHandle SHPCreate( const char * pszShapeFile, int nShapeType );

  pszShapeFile:		The name of the layer to access.  This can be the
			name of either the .shp or the .shx file or can
			just be the path plus the basename of the pair.

  nShapeType:		The type of shapes to be stored in the newly created
			file.  It may be either SHPT_POINT, SHPT_ARC, 
		        SHPT_POLYGON or SHPT_MULTIPOINT.

  The SHPCreate() function will create a new .shp and .shx file of the
  desired type.

                  ------------------------------------------

int SHPWriteVertices( SHPHandle hSHP, int nVCount, int nPartCount,
	              int * panParts, double * padVertices );

  hSHP:			The handle previously returned by SHPOpen() 
			or SHPCreate().

  nVCount:		The number of vertices in padVertices.  

  nPartCount:		The number of parts found in panParts.  Should
			be zero for SHPT_POINT and SHPT_MULTIPOINT.

  panParts:		List of parts, may be NULL for SHPT_POINT and
			SHPT_MULTIPOINT.  For SHPT_ARC and SHPT_POLYGON
			it must have at least one entry (0) indicating that
			the first part starts at the zeroth vertex.

  padVertices:		The list of vertices (nVCount * 2 doubles). 

  The SHPWriteVertices() function is used to write a new entity/shape to
  a shape file created with SHPCreate(), or opened with the "r+" access string
  in SHPOpen().  

  The return value of this function is the entity number of the newly written
  shapefile which will always be the new number of entities less one.

Attribute (DBF) API
-------------------

Please see the shapefil.h include file, and dbfcreate.c, dbfadd.c and dbfdump.c
example applications for hints on how to use the DBF interface.  I hope to
document the DBP api here in the future.  Let me know (warmerda@leto.pci.on.ca)
if you would like this to happen.
